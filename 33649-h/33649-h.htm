            When we receive with an entire and perfect resignation
            the afflictions which God sends us they become for us
            favors and benefits; because conformity to the will of
            God is a gain far superior to all temporal
            advantages.&mdash;ST. VINCENT DE PAUL.

            All perfection consists in the love of God; and the

            A single act of resignation to the divine will in what
            it ordains contrary to our desires, is of more value
            than a hundred thousand successes conformable to our

            As long as we are in this mortal life, nothing is more
            necessary for us than humility.&mdash;ST. TERESA.

            Learning without humility has always been pernicious to
            the Church; and as pride precipitated the rebellious
            angels from heaven, it frequently causes the loss of
            learned men.&mdash;ST. VINCENT DE PAUL.

            Why remain sad and idle? Why exhaust thyself in the
            anguish of melancholy? Have courage, do violence to
            thyself; meditate on the passion of Jesus Christ, and
            thou shalt overcome thy sorrow.&mdash;BL. HENRY SUSO.

            Here is the difference between the joys of the world
            and the cross of Jesus Christ: after having tasted the
            first, one is disgusted with them; and on the contrary,
            the more one partakes of the cross, the greater the
            thirst for it.&mdash;ST. IGNATIUS.

            When the sky is free from clouds we can see more
            clearly the brightness of the sun. In like manner, when
            the soul is free from sin and the gloom of passion, it
            participates in the divine light.&mdash;VEN. LOUIS DE

            If we are very determined to mortify ourselves and not

            To establish ourselves in a virtue it is necessary to
            form good and practical resolutions to perform certain
